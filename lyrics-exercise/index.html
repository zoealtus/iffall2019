			<div>Hold on, I thought that I could take it from here<br>
			Oh, I thought that I was gone and I'm cleared<br>
			Now it's getting harder (ooh)<br>
			Hold on, I thought that I was doing so well<br>
			Oh, like everything was under a spell<br>
			Now it's getting harder<br>
			<br>
			I never loved you fully in the way I could<br>
			I fought the current running just the way you would<br>
			And now I'm in the creek<br>
			And it's getting harder<br>
			I'm like falling water<br>
			<br>
			Go on and tell me just what I'm supposed to say<br>
			As if it could be any other way<br>
			Oh, it's getting louder<br>
			Go on and tell me just how I could allow<br>
			All that's light to end up somehow<br>
			Where it's getting darker<br>
			<br>
			I never loved you fully in the way I could<br>
			I fought the current running just the way you would<br>
			And now I'm stuck upstream<br>
			And it's getting harder<br>
			I'm like falling water, falling water, falling water<br>
			<br>
			Mmm, mmm<br>
			<br>
			And I'm like falling water, set me free<br>
			You were like falling water coming down on me<br>
			<br>
			I never loved you fully in the way I could<br>
			I fought the current running just the way you would<br>
			And now I'm in the creek<br>
			<br>
			I never gave you everything, I wish I could<br>
			I should've seen it coming from where you stood<br>
			But now I'm in the creek<br>
			And it's getting harder<br>
			I am like falling water<br>
			(In the creek, ooh, ooh)</div>
