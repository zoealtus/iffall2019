			<div>Hold on, I thought that I could take it from here
			Oh, I thought that I was gone and I'm cleared
			Now it's getting harder (ooh)
			Hold on, I thought that I was doing so well
			Oh, like everything was under a spell
			Now it's getting harder
			I never loved you fully in the way I could
			I fought the current running just the way you would
			And now I'm in the creek
			And it's getting harder
			I'm like falling water
			Go on and tell me just what I'm supposed to say
			As if it could be any other way
			Oh, it's getting louder
			Go on and tell me just how I could allow
			All that's light to end up somehow
			Where it's getting darker
			I never loved you fully in the way I could
			I fought the current running just the way you would
			And now I'm stuck upstream
			And it's getting harder
			I'm like falling water, falling water, falling water
			Mmm, mmm
			And I'm like falling water, set me free
			You were like falling water coming down on me
			I never loved you fully in the way I could
			I fought the current running just the way you would
			And now I'm in the creek
			I never gave you everything, I wish I could
			I should've seen it coming from where you stood
			But now I'm in the creek
			And it's getting harder
			I am like falling water
			(In the creek, ooh, ooh)</div>
