			<h4>Healthy Tip</h4>
			<p>Instead of using only wheat flour in these pancakes, I've combined whole-wheat flour and almond flour. The almond flour makes for a very moist and delicate pancake. Almond flour is high in vitamin E, calcium, magnesium and copper.</p>

			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
				<p>1 cup (140 grams) whole-wheat flour</p>
				<p>1/2 cup (60 grams) almond flour</p>
				<p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
				<p>1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
				<p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
				<p>2 eggs</p>
				<p>1 tablespoon maple syrup</p>
				<p>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</p>
				<p>2 tablespoons canola oil</p>
				<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
				<p>1/2 cup (60 grams) chopped pecans</p>
				<p>1/2 cup dried cranberries</p>
				<p>Butter or oil as needed for cooking</p>

			<h4>Preparation</h4>
				<div class="Step 1">Step 1</div>
					<p>Sift together the flours, baking powder, baking soda and salt</p>

					Step 2
					<p>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Whisk in the maple syrup, buttermilk, canola oil and vanilla. Quickly whisk in the flour mix. Fold in the pecans and the cranberries. Do not overwork the batter</p>

					Step 3
					<p>Heat a griddle or a large skillet, either nonstick or seasoned cast iron, over medium-high heat. Brush with butter or oil. Use a 1/4-cup ladle or cup measure to drop 3 to 4 tablespoons of batter per pancake onto your heated pan or griddle. When bubbles break through the pancakes, carefully slide a spatula under them (they are delicate), flip them over and cook for another minute, until they are brown on the other side. Serve right away, or allow to cool and wrap individual servings in plastic, then place in a freezer bag and freeze</p>

			<h5>Tip</h5>
				<span class="italic">Advance preparation:</span> The pancakes can be frozen for a few months. You can make them a day ahead and reheat in a low oven or in a microwave.
