			<li> Hi! My name is Zoe Altus, I'm majoring in Communication Design and Anthropology and I'm a junior. </li>
			<li> While I'm taking this class as a requirement, I'm interested in learning web design fundamentals as I would like to work in customer experience and user interface design. </li>
			<li> I was in the engineering school as a freshman when I got to WashU, so I took Comp Sci 131 and learned some JavaScript. I liked it but the programming did not always come easily to me.</li>
			<li> I hope to learn how to incorporate hovering into a web page using pictures or within menus on a website.</li>
			<li> Designing for a screen is different than paper because the canvas you're working on can scroll for an infinite amount of time and that has to be well thought-out.</li>
			<li> I think that the <a href="https://www.pentagram.com">Pentagram</a> website is very effectively designed. Each time you arrive on the home page there is a new project which makes it interesting to visit multiple times. Additionally, you can scroll down and access past projects from different categories (brand identity, environmental graphics, etc.)  </li>
			<li> The <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse"> Netflix</a> website does a good job of communicating all of their offerings to the user. After selecting a title, users can further browse by actor, genre, or "more like this." </li>
			<li> I think <a href="https://quizlet.com/latest"> Quizlet</a> has a well designed website. When you first arrive, your most recently studied sets show up in the middle, along with a well organized menu on the side to show all of your folders and classes. </li>
