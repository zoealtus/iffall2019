		<h4>Feedback for Steven Lee</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I really like the font you chose for the Groot one. However, I think that in order to keep them visually similar it won’t work as well for the longer quotes</li>

			<li>Also on both the desktop and mobile orientations, the words are a little close to the edge of the frame</li>

			<li>On the second set: the mobile version has some words bolded but its not so contrasted that it’s easy to see at that size</li>

			<li>On the Iron Man one, the red is a little difficult to read in a couple places</li>
