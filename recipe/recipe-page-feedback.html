		<ul>
			<li>(Issue with css that could not be solved so I am looking at your mockup)</li>

			<li>Try making all of your headings bold</li>

			<li>Spacing is nice and I like how you have a picture at the beginning and end of your recipe, along with a link to the recipe </li>

			<li>Point size works for body copy and is a little big for the first heading </li>
