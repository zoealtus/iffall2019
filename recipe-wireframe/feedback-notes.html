	Love the title typeface

	Maybe indent the ingredients? For mine, I was thinking the ingredients would take up the whole screen…like a whole page for the ingredients. You could maybe increase the leading a little bit

	Preparation has a space after it but Ingredients doesn’t. Decide if you want to use a space or not. 

	I think the headings for Ingredients and Preparation could increase point size. 

	Step one has a widow (salt), but I don’t know how much that matters

	I like the tip with the italics, and the picture at the bottom

	Step 3 is really long…maybe condense that step.

	I like the way the 14 pt size looks on a laptop, but I’m thinking that if I was cooking, it might be too small on my phone. Consider going a little larger, and additionally making the headers larger
